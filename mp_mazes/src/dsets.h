 * Each DisjointSets object represents a family of disjoint sets, where each
 * element has an integer index. It is implemented with the optimizations
 * discussed in class, as up-trees stored in a single vector of ints.
 * Specifically, path compression and union-by-size are used. Each place in the
 * vector represents a node. (Note that this means that the elements in our
 * universe are indexed starting at 0.) A nonnegative number is the index of the
 * parent of the current node; a negative number in a root node is the negative
 * of the set size.
 *
 * Note that the default compiler-supplied Big Three will work flawlessly
 * because the only member data is a vector of integers and this vector should
 * initially be empty.
